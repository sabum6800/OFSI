abstract: >
  The Observer Frequency Structure Interpretation (OFSI) is an interpretative
  hypothesis addressing foundational aspects of the quantum measurement
  process within standard quantum mechanics. It introduces no new physical
  theory, no new dynamics or equations, and no new quantitative predictions. OFSI
  interprets the measurement transition not as a pointlike ontological collapse, but
  as a structured reduction of dynamical accessibility of quantum state information
  through coupling and stabilization. The concepts employed serve solely as
  structural and interpretative tools and possess no independent physical or
  ontological status. OFSI is fully consistent with standard quantum mechanics and
  aims to provide a coherent interpretative account of the quantum-to-classical
  transition without extending existing physics.
