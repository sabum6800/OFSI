# Observer Frequency Structure Interpretation (OFSI)

**OFSI** is an interpretative framework for the **quantum measurement problem** within **standard quantum mechanics**.
It addresses the **quantum-to-classical transition**, **measurement / collapse language**, and the role of **environmental coupling (decoherence context)** from an explicitly interpretative perspective.

**Keywords:** interpretation of quantum mechanics, quantum measurement problem, quantum-to-classical transition, decoherence, wave function collapse, Born rule, quantum state, measurement, emergence of classicality
